    Response cards, or non-Papal Home cards (Papal Bull and Leipzig Debate may be
    cancelled). Discard the event; this player's impulse is over. Protestant may
    not initiate debates for rest of turn. Commit Luther (if not already); he can

    Immediately initiate an assault by a besieging power on the units within the
    fortifications.  If after the assault, the besieging units still outnumber the
    units within, apply these results: all defending units are eliminated;
    defending leaders are captured; space becomes controlled by besieging power.
